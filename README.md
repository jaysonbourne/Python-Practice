# Python-Practice
A repository for small, quick exercises used to refresh my memory with Python and Django terminology and practices.

On another note I am primarily doing this run through in Python 3. The terminology is mostly the same in my brief experience thus far but I am seeing some small differences but not enough to throw me off.
